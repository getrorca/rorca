## 2026-02-27 [Architecture] Direction Stack 5-Layer Cascade
> Rule: Direction Stack layers cascade L1 (global) → L5 (story annotations). Lower layers override higher ones, like CSS specificity.
> Context: L1-L2 are global engineering/domain principles. L3+ are per-workspace. L4/L5 come from spec brief and story annotations.
> Source: CIE-003

## 2026-02-27 [Convention] Spec ID vs specName
> Rule: spec.id is the filename slug (use for API calls and path construction). spec.specName is the human-readable title (display only).
> Context: Confusing these causes file-not-found errors in pipeline trigger and archive panel.
> Source: v2-platform

## 2026-03-10 [Gotcha] pg is async — always await DB calls
> Rule: All DB calls (query, queryOne, execute) are async via pg Pool. Always use `await`. Use `$1, $2, ...` numbered placeholders (NOT `?`).
> Context: Missing `await` returns a Promise instead of data. PostgreSQL uses numbered placeholders, not positional `?`.
> Source: rorca-postgres-migration PG-011

## 2026-02-27 [Convention] chatComplete returns ChatResult
> Rule: chatComplete() returns ChatResult { text, usage } — always use .text accessor, never treat result as a string.
> Context: The return type was changed from string to ChatResult in US-003 (model selection). All callers must use .text.
> Source: US-003

## 2026-02-27 [Gotcha] Backend requires restart after changes
> Rule: tsx has no hot-reload. Always kill port 3030 and restart after backend changes: lsof -ti:3030 | xargs kill -9 && npm run dev
> Context: Changes to backend code are not picked up automatically. Forgetting to restart causes stale behavior.
> Source: v2-platform

## 2026-02-28 [Architecture] Context Router uses virtual file assembly
> Rule: Context is assembled virtually at runtime — no physical file scatter. Path-based scoping + tag injection + token budget enforcement.
> Context: .rorca/config.json routing section defines globals, scopes, and tags. micromatch handles glob matching.
> Source: CIE-004

## 2026-02-28 [Architecture] Episodic Memory is structured Markdown
> Rule: MEMORY.md entries follow format: ## YYYY-MM-DD [Category] Title / > Rule: / > Context: / > Source: story-id
> Context: Machine-readable, human-editable. Categories: Architecture, Convention, Bug Fix, Decision, Pattern, Gotcha.
> Source: CIE-005

## 2026-03-01 [Gotcha] Wave-based execution blocks dependent stories on single failure
> Rule: When wave execution is enabled, a single story failure in wave 0 causes all dependent stories to skip with reason='blocked_by'
> Context: SM-001 failed in wave 0, causing SM-002, SM-004, and SM-006 to skip despite not being directly tested. This cascading failure pattern means early wave failures have exponential impact on run completion rate.
> Source: SM-001

## 2026-03-01 [Convention] TypeScript typecheck failures require immediate resolution
> Rule: Stories must pass `npx tsc --noEmit` validation before being marked as passed, even if runtime behavior appears correct
> Context: SM-001 failed with reason='typecheck' despite potentially working at runtime. The execution engine enforces strict type safety as a quality gate. Always verify both frontend and backend type checks before committing.
> Source: SM-001

## 2026-03-01 [Pattern] Marketplace UI components follow extract-then-enhance pattern
> Rule: When adding features to marketplace panels, first extract shared utilities (SM-003: renderMarkdown), then build new UI features (SM-005: category filters) on top of the shared foundation
> Context: SM-003 and SM-005 passed while SM-001 failed, suggesting the incremental approach of establishing shared utilities before complex features reduces integration risk.
> Source: SM-003

## 2026-03-08 [Decision] PostgreSQL Migration Supersedes SQLite Optimization
> Rule: When planning production infrastructure, choose PostgreSQL from day one rather than optimizing SQLite then migrating later
> Context: PR-049 and PR-050 (SQLite optimization + benchmarks) were superseded by the rorca-postgres-migration spec. This teaches us that production-grade DB decisions should be made upfront, not incrementally optimized from dev-grade solutions.
> Source: rorca-postgres-migration

## 2026-03-08 [Convention] Rate Limiter Configuration Uses Database Table
> Rule: Rate limits are stored in the `rate_limits` DB table with 30s cache; defaults are 100 req/min authenticated, 20 req/min unauthenticated
> Context: To change limits: UPDATE rate_limits table then call invalidateRateLimitCache() or restart backend. Skipped in NODE_ENV=test unless RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true. Implemented in rate-limiter.ts.
> Source: PR-NEW-1

## 2026-03-08 [Pattern] Production Hardening Follows Layered Security Model
> Rule: Production readiness requires CORS hardening (PR-NEW-2), rate limiting (PR-NEW-1), secrets management (vault_keys table), and health checks — implement all four layers, not just one
> Context: The production-ready spec shows these are interdependent: rate limiting without CORS leaves attack vectors open; health checks without secrets management can't validate encrypted data access.
> Source: rorca-production-ready

## 2026-03-08 [Architecture] Docker Compose as Primary Self-Hosted Distribution
> Rule: Self-hosted distribution uses Docker Compose with Postgres 16 + pgvector + Apache AGE + Rorca backend — single `docker compose up` command
> Context: PR-003 establishes Docker Compose as the canonical self-hosted deployment method. This supersedes manual npm install flows and ensures consistent environments across installations.
> Source: PR-003

## 2026-03-08 [Convention] Health Checks Return Structured Component Breakdown
> Rule: Health endpoints must return both aggregate score and per-component status (CLAUDE.md 30pt, AGENTS.md 20pt, config.json 20pt, MEMORY.md 15pt, skills 15pt)
> Context: Implemented via workspace-echolocation.ts echolocate() function. Penalties apply: CLAUDE.md < 10 lines = half credit, < 50 lines = 75% credit. This structured breakdown enables actionable remediation.
> Source: CIE workspace health

## 2026-03-08 [Pattern] Spec Queue Panel Uses Dual-Tab Architecture
> Rule: Queue-style panels (review queue, run queue) use a dual-tab pattern: 'pending' + 'history' tabs with shared data fetching and SSE subscriptions
> Context: PR-QUEUE-1 (Spec Review Queue Panel) establishes this pattern. Both tabs subscribe to the same SSE stream but filter differently. Prevents code duplication and ensures real-time consistency across views.
> Source: PR-QUEUE-1

## 2026-03-10 [Convention] PostgreSQL Migration Pattern
> Rule: Migrations live in `backend/src/db/pg-migrations/` as numbered SQL files. Tracked via `schema_migrations` table (not filesystem). Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` guards freely — PostgreSQL supports them natively.
> Context: Supersedes the old SQLite pragma table_info workaround. PostgreSQL supports `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.
> Source: rorca-postgres-migration PG-011

## 2026-03-08 [Decision] Feature Badges Use Semantic Versioning Gates
> Rule: New features get badges (e.g. 'New in v2.1') tied to semantic version checks — frontend shows prompts for features available in current version but not yet used
> Context: PR-052 implements upgrade prompts + feature badges. This creates a progressive disclosure UX where users discover features organically rather than via docs. Version gate prevents showing unavailable features.
> Source: PR-052

## 2026-03-08 [Convention] Plan Quotas Enforced via Middleware Not Route Logic
> Rule: Usage quotas (plan limits, token budgets) are enforced via requirePlan middleware attached to routes, not inline in route handlers
> Context: PR-051 creates plan_quotas table + requirePlan middleware. This centralizes enforcement logic and makes quota changes (free → paid tier) declarative. Route handlers stay clean.
> Source: PR-051

## 2026-03-12 [Bug Fix] MCP rorca_list_specs and rorca_list_runs wrong response shape
> Rule: Both tools assumed wrong API response shapes. rorca_list_specs treated response as a bare array but API returns { items: [...] }. rorca_list_runs destructured { runs } but API returns { items: [...] }. Fixed by normalizing: Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data.items ?? []) for list_specs, and payload.runs ?? payload.items ?? [] for list_runs. Also fixed specName field: API uses specName not title — display as s.specName ?? s.title ?? s.id.
> Context: backend/src/mcp/server.ts lines 108-115 (list_specs) and 432-436 (list_runs). Errors were: "specs.map is not a function" and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"

## 2026-03-12 [Pattern] MCP tools vs prompts — tools are Claude-callable, prompts are user slash commands
> Rule: MCP tools (server.registerTool) are called by Claude automatically during conversation. MCP prompts (server.registerPrompt) become user-invocable slash commands: /mcp__rorca__<name> [args]. Prompts use argsSchema (ZodRawShape, same as inputSchema for tools) and return { messages: [{ role: 'user', content: { type: 'text', text: '...' } }] }. All 24 Rorca tools now have corresponding prompt slash commands in backend/src/mcp/server.ts. Exceptions: edit_story, update_direction, create_workspace, team_members left as tools-only (complex multi-line inputs awkward as CLI args). generate_spec added as both tool AND prompt — takes quoted args: /mcp__rorca__generate_spec "slug" "brief".
> Context: backend/src/mcp/server.ts — prompts section starts at ~line 1065 with DEFAULT_WORKSPACE = 'rorcha'. MCP server requires VS Code window reload to pick up file changes (stdio process does not hot-reload). /mcp command shows connection status but does NOT restart the process.
